- `SHOW TRIGGERS` looks messy but lists triggers
- `use` <database>
- `DROP TRIGGER` <triggername>
- `INSERT INTO` follows(follower_id, followee_id) VALUES (7,7)
- WARNING: Triggers CAN MAKE DEBUGGING HARD!
- Triggers are stealth little bugs waiting to happen. Can't tell what goes wrong in a trigger...
- If you have a bunch of triggers at someone doesn't know about it, it can be a problem. magic happening under the hood with triggers.
- Typically a better way than using alot of triggers. Otherwise it really may be a good use case of a trigger.
- not explicit when something happens. too many triggers can be a problem. try not to use them randomly.
